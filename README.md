# Data Visualizition Using Python
"The purpose of this study is to demonstrate the exchange rate fluctuations between USD and Bitcoin over a 5-year period using graphs, and to observe how well the Linear Regression and Decision Tree algorithms can predict actual data. I prepared this assignment for my Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning course in my third year at Yeditepe University. You can access and review it on Google Colab."
